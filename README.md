# MUTEMOTION 

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

MuteMotion envisions a world where transportation is truly
              inclusive, empowering every individual to navigate the roads
              safely and seamlessly
             
              At MuteMotion, we are committed to developing innovative solutions
              that not only enhance road safety but also promote awareness of
              sign language and deaf culture.
             
              Join us as we embark on this transformative journey to create a
              more inclusive and accessible transportation ecosystem for all.
              Together, we can drive change and make a lasting
              impact on society.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
